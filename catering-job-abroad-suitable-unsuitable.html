              <h1>Are you suitable or unsuitable for a hospitality</h1>

              <p>
                The hospitality industry is not an easy industry. Working hours
                vary enormously. Sometimes you work a shift from 12.00 noon to
                01.00 at night. And the other time you're already ready at 22.00
                and you can go home earlier.
              </p>
              <p>
                You walk back and forth a lot with heavy trays and you always
                have to be friendly with the customer. Customers naturally want
                to be served by a cheerful person because they expect good
                service. Customers in the hospitality industry are usually
                always cheerful. That makes the work very diverse.
              </p>

              <p>
                Everyone wants to have a chat with you, they give compliments
                about the work you do and of course that tip! There are both
                advantages and disadvantages to this industry. Read on to see if
                it is something for you and what you can earn from it!
              </p>
              <h2>Why work in the hospitality industry?</h2>
              <p>
                Clients in the hospitality industry are usually always cheerful.
                They go out for a nice meal and want to experience a pleasant
                evening. Because of this, they are often cheerful to the
                restaurant staff, so to you! That also makes your work more fun.
              </p>
              <p>
                A part-time job in the hospitality industry can earn you extra
                money quickly and at short notice. If you need money in the
                short term for a holiday or a car you want to buy, the
                hospitality industry is an ideal option to quickly earn money.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is also possible that you don't go on holiday for once. A job
                in the hospitality industry can then be a great holiday job! The
                customers you meet are often tourists. They have nice stories
                about what they have seen or maybe they just ask for things.
                Maybe you get an extra tip for this.
              </p>
              <h2>Personnel in the hospitality industry</h2>
              <p>
                In the hospitality industry you can expand your network
                unnoticed! You have Dutch customers, but businessmen who come
                for a bite to eat. Do you have a quick chat, or does a
                businessman leave his business card behind? Chances are he is
                interested in you!
              </p>
              <p>What are the disadvantages of the hospitality industry?</p>
              <p>
                Times vary a lot. That's why it's hard to plan and make time for
                yourself. It can also be debilitating on your body. Even if
                you've had a late night shift, when the next shift starts at
                noon on your schedule, you just have to rotate it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Wages in the hospitality industry are not the highest and career
                opportunities are scarce.
              </p>
              <p>
                Employment is very seasonal. In the summer there is a lot of
                demand for labour in the hospitality industry. However, when
                winter sets in, demand decreases sharply. If this is your
                permanent job, it can have a big impact on your fixed income.
              </p>
              <h2>Hospitality industry abroad?</h2>
              <p>
                Would you rather work abroad in the hospitality industry? That
                is also possible! Dutch tourists go every year to countries like
                Italy, France or Spain. There is always a demand for Dutch
                personnel abroad.
